# Table of Contents

## CSS

All css files can be found in the `css` folder, including imported
files from Bootstrap, Fontawesome; aswell as more custom stylesheets.
Regarding custom files, each will be named accordingly to their
functionality and purpose.

### Minifying CSS Files

Each `.css` file will have a minified version of it. ***DO NOT EDIT THOSE***,
but rather edit their original files.

Once you're done editing a CSS stylesheet, make sure to minify it with the `minify`
command. To install it, simply run:

```bash
$ npm install -g minify
```

Once it is installed, you must minify each css style you've edited.
For example:

```bash
$ minify example.css > example.min.css
```

**Make sure to preserve the location for each stylesheet, minified or not!**

## Presskit

The `presskit` folder contains the zip file that can be downloaded at
https://tosdr.org/presskit. **DO NOT MODIFY IT UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN**
**EXPLICIT PERMISSIONS AND/OR INSTRUCTIONS!**

## JS

### Minifying JS Files

**The same principle from [_Minifying CSS Files_](#minifying-css-files) applies with**
**`.js` files, just with their appropriate file extensions.**
